#+TITLE: .humacs.d -> .emacs.d
* Problem

Lots of moving targets:

- emacs (we currently require 26.3)
- spacemacs (currently following develop)
- our spacemacs configuration (always evolving)
- The community elpa / package dependencies update several times a day

* Solution

Create a repo with submodules pinning our dependencies

: git clone git@github.com:humacs/.humacs.d ~/.emacs.d

The submodules are defined in *.gitmodules*

: cd ~/.emacs.d && git submodule init && git submodule update

We forked and created develop branch, which can follow our dependencies

* Issues

** elpa-mirror is producing errors when used

Seems related to package signing
